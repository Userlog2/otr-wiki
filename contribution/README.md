# o!TR Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the osu! Tournament Rating project in its early stages.
We greatly appreciate all contributions, especially feedback from tournament players and community figures.

## General Feedback

General feedback can be left under each repository's discussion page. Here, you can ask questions, voice concerns, and more, and get responses from the o!TR team.
We actually prefer this to a Discord-centered discussion approach due to how organized discussions are (and they can be linked with issues / PRs).

## Code Contributions

We accept code contributions from all, though we will expect them to be of quality, thoroughly tested, and reviewed by members of the dev team before being merged.

### Outside Contributors

1. If you see an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment and one of the maintainers will assign you the issue. Feel free to ask for help in the issue along the way.
2. When you think you have all of the requirements completed, please open a pull request (PR). Thoroughly explain your code changes and reasoning behind the changes. Keep your PRs as bite-sized as possible. Smaller PRs get merged much faster, very large PRs are difficult to review quickly. Touch as few files as necessary to complete your feature / bug fix.
3. Inside the PR, maintainers will engage in code review. It is expected that all changes requested during the review process are fixed. Generally, all CI checks must pass before merging (though in the very early stages, we are still working through this ourselves).

### Contributions From Maintainers

o!TR maintainers of all projects are expected to adhere to the following practices:

* Self-assign issues you intend to work on or are actively working on. If you deem it necessary, you may assign issues to a maintainer better-suited for that task. Aim to complete assigned work quickly if possible in order to prevent tasks from growing stale.
* Create issues for items you are working on if they do not already exist and self-assign if appropriate.
* Create issues for items you know need to be worked on but do not have an issue yet.
* Always request at least one review from a fellow maintainer and/or @hburn7
* Always approve or request changes on PRs where you are assigned as a reviewer in a timely fashion. PRs that have a reviewer assigned but with no feedback from said reviewer should never be merged.
* Always link to any issues that PRs address. Adding a line such as `closes #12` is sufficient.
* Always resolve all conversations in a PR before merging.
