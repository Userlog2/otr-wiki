# Authorization Flow

We offer a way for third-party clients to access our API via the OAuth2 standard. Currently, the API is not open for public use. Access will be rolled out in a limited fashion at first before granting broad public usage.

In order to use our API, you must familiarize yourself with our [usage limits](../limits/en.md), else risk being suspended from accessing our API.
