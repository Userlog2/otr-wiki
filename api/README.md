# o!TR API
Welcome to the documentation of the otr-api. You can use this API to interact with o!TR and obtain various information about osu! tournaments and those who play them.

At the moment, consider this documentation to be a permanent work in progress as we continue to refine o!TR while working towards an official release.

If you encounter errors in this documentation or in the API, please check the [issues](https://github.com/osu-tournament-rating/otr-api/issues) section of the API repository. Alternatively you can bring up any concerns in the official [discord]().
